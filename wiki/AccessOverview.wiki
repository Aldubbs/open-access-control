= Introduction =
This article is designed to help with the actual implementation of the Open Access Control system in a facility such as a hacker space or home.

==Requirements==
In order to implement this project at your space, the following items are recommended.

  * The latest [http://code.google.com/p/open-access-control/downloads/list Open Access Control hardware]. You can have the board fabricated or purchase one from the [http://shop.23b.org 23b Shop]. All of the parts listed in the Bill of Materials (available in the downloads folder) are available from [http://www.digikey.com Digikey], [http://www.mouser.com Mouser], and other common sources.

  * An [http://arduino.cc Arduino] or compatible micro controller and the latest Arduino software. We have tested with the Duemillanove, Uno and [http://www.freeduino.org/ FreeDuino]. You will need one with an Atmega 328 for this project.

  * A power supply suitable for the peak current load of all of your door hardware as well as the access control itself. We use a 5A, switching power supply and the UPS circuit. You will need a PS that can be adjusted up to 15V if you wish to use the UPS circuit. Fully operational, our system draws about 600ma with a door magnet, the access system, battery float charging, several alarm sensors, and an Arduino Ethernet module.

  * Some type of enclosure. Suggestions would be to either look for an old alarm panel to guy (call an installer and ask for the old ones?) or a NEMA-format electrical box. These are available from electrician's supply shops for a reasonable price.

  * Alarm sensors such as door magnets, motion detectors, glass-break sensors, etc if using the alarm or door chime features

  * Door hardware, such as an [http://shop.ebay.com/?_from=R40&_trksid=p5197.m570.l1313&_nkw=electric+strike electric strike], mortise-style electric latch or [http://shop.ebay.com/i.html?_nkw=magnetic+door+lock&_sacat=0&_odkw=door+magnet+lock door magnet]. [http://hubpages.com/hub/Electrifying-an-Aluminum-Store-Front-Opening Glass front shop doors] are a bit more expensive to electrify but there is [http://www.adamsrite.com/media/pdf/v2/sw32_4593.pdf drop-in] [http://www.adamsrite.com/NewFiles/e-latch.pdf hardware] to do it.

  A low-budget way to electrify a standard residential door is to hack a [http://www.schlage.com/ Schlage] or similar keyless door lock that uses batteries and a PIN code.

  * RFID, PIN pads or other access readers. Look for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiegand_interface Wiegand] interface door readers. The HID brand is the most widely deployed for buildings, but is proprietary and expensive. The open-standards alternative is EM4100, which is available in abundance on [http://shop.ebay.com/?_from=R40&_trksid=p5197.m570.l1313&_nkw=EM4100&_sacat=See-All-Categories eBay] or from Internet shops. Wiegand stuff is usually good for up to 500 feet of cable run  if you use shielded cable. You could also use RS232-based readers, but we have not tested this.

  * A key bypass. Since you will likely be tinkering with the code and "stuff" happens, it is advisable to have an alternate way into your space. Some suggestions including leaving a secondary door available for key access and/or installing electric hardware that includes a keyed cylinder.

==Safety Considerations==
When planning for your installation, you need to be aware of fire codes and safety issues. Our experience was basically the following:
  * You cannot lock the exit doors from people inside. Any door in the exit path must have a mechanical device to allow exit regardless of the electronics state. If you can't do that (such as with a door magnet) then the fire codes typically require that your system have both a request-to-exit motion sensor and a button near the door which interrupts power and allows exit.

  * If you are installing access hardware on a fire-rated door, you cannot make any alterations to the door and you may need to buy specific hardware. Basically, these are solid doors that are rated to withstand a fire for a certain number of minutes. Drilling holes or removing material from them voids the rating and puts you on the hook for replacing the door. Look for a fire-rating sticker somewhere on the frame or hinges, and talk to the building owner if in doubt.
